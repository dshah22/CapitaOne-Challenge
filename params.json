The project essentially finds 35 most recent posts from Instagram with #capitalone and displays statistics of the media and the associated user. It also performs a sentiment analysis of the caption targeted towards Capital One.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n  - Python libraries: [httplib2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/httplib2), [json](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/),  [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#distribute-pip)\r\n  - Python-Instagram Library that can be found [here](https://github.com/Instagram/python-instagram)\r\n  - An ACCESS_TOKEN from [Instagram](https://instagram.com/developer/) to read media and user statistics. \r\n  - An ACCESS_TOKEN from [AlchemyAPI](www.alchemyapi.com) to generate sentiment analysis.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n - Once you have the access tokens, open insta.py and replace the values in following variables with your own values.\r\n`\r\n``` sh \r\n$ client_id = 'XXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\n$ client_secret = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\n$ access_token = 'XXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\n$ client_ip = 'XX.XXX.XX.XXX                                                                   \r\n```  \r\n\r\n - Then open 'api_key.txt' file and place your AlchemyAPI API Key in there. Please do not type anything else in it.\r\n - To run the script just type \r\n``` sh \r\n$ python insta.py\r\n``` \r\n - If everything went well, then you should be able see the list of posts followed by the user statistics.\r\n \r\n### Visual Representation (Optional Deliverable)\r\n   - I tried to create a visual representation of User data, using third-party libraries and modifying it for our purpose. The contents of the Visual Representation are located in the ''Display'' directory. \r\n ```sh\r\n    $ cd Display\r\n```\r\n - Open config.ini file in a text editor of your choice, and insert your ACCESS_TOKEN received from instagram.\r\n ``` sh\r\n     access_token = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\n ```\r\n  - Then just run the Python script as \r\n  ```sh\r\n     $ python getIGstat.py\r\n```\r\n - This will create a database of the user mentioned in the username variable of the config.ini file, and then display the statistics of the User's posts, no. of followers, most likes and comments in a timely manner in a HTML coded web page. Sometimes, when the user has large number of followers/posts, we might get an error and will not be able to see the media, as Instagram limits its API calls to 5000 /hour per access token. To view these :\r\n ```sh \r\n     $ cd htdocs \r\n     $ open index.html\r\n```\r\n - This will open the webpage in your default Web Browser.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Future Plans\r\n\r\n - Future plans for the project include, creating a visual representation for the statistics of top 30 users who used #capitalone in their posts.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Version\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n - Darpan Shah\r\n - Email: dshah22@umd.edu\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
